This custom Blender 2.70 key configuration for MacBooks is based on the 'Blender (default)' key configuration. Shortcuts have been replaced to their 'Blender (default)' positions on the keyboard, with some alterations given the following restrictions and preferences:

- No 'delete' key.
	- Replaced with the backspace key.
- No 'insert' key.
	- @TODO Assign replacement.
- No numpad keys.
	- Numpad number key have been replaced with main number row keys with modifiers.
	- `numpad .` has been replaced with `shift+v`.
- No 'page up' or 'page down' keys
	- @TODO Assign replacement.
- No 'home' key.
	- Replaced with the backslash (`\`) key.
- No 'end' key.
	- Replaced with the hyphen (`-`) key.

- Copy (`command+c`), cut (`command+x`), paste (`command+v`), save (`command+s`), undo (`command+z`), quit (`command+q`), hide (`command+h`), and minimize (`command+m`) shortcuts are in the same place as other applications for MacBook Dvorak keyboard layout users.
- To remove key conflicts, the command (`cmd`) key is used for the above shortcuts, and control (`ctrl`) is used for everything else.
